## Dump the plaintext credentials to a local storage (USB, SDCard, etc.)
### You can use whatever local storage you want/can!
### Step 1
####  Put the scripts into the root directory of your disk drive.
### Step 2
####  Open the payload for your HID device (Rubber Ducky or Teensy)
### Step 3
####  Grab the label of your local storage device and put it in the payload
### Step 4
####  Compile and enjoy ;)
### Note:
#### Even if you don't have a HID device you can use this attack using the batch file...
